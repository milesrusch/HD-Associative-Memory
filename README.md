## Welcome to EE241B Spring 2016 HD Associative Memory Project

**Abstract:** For our EE241B project, we have chosen to analyze the performance (selectivity, power, area, speed, etc.) of various sparse associative memories and compare them with more conventional RAM in the context of high dimensional (HD) computational classifiers. Sparse associative memories are seen as an important building block for high dimensional (HD) computational classifiers as they may allow for faster, more energy efficient classification as the number of classes grows.
